# Project Renaming Consideration

## Issue
The project name "Clarity" conflicts with an existing, well-established programming language used on the Stacks blockchain. This creates several problems:

1. **Confusion**: Users may confuse this project with the existing Clarity blockchain language
2. **SEO Issues**: Search results will mix both projects
3. **Trademark Risks**: Potential legal issues with name collision
4. **Community Confusion**: Established community around the existing Clarity language

## Proposed New Name
**CLAR** - Collaborative Language for AI Reasoning (pronounced "clare")

This name:
- Avoids direct conflict with the existing Clarity language
- Still captures the collaborative nature of the project
- Reflects the AI Reasoning focus
- Is distinctive enough for SEO purposes

## Alternative Names Considered
- DualScript
- Lucid
- Cortex
- CollabLang
- ARIA (AI Reasoning and Intelligence Assistant Language)

## Action Items
1. Update all references from "Clarity" to "CLAR"
2. Update documentation to reflect new name
3. Update code comments and internal references
4. Communicate name change to any stakeholders

The name change should happen early in the project lifecycle to minimize downstream impact as the project grows.
